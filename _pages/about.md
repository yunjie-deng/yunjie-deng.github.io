I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Sukarno Mertoguno](https://sites.gatech.edu/karno/), starting from Fall 2023.

My research interests lie in **System Security**, **GPU Security**, and **Hardware-assisted Security**.

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned my M.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Fengwei Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io/). I also obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from SUSTech in 2020, advised by [Prof. Xin Yao](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/).
